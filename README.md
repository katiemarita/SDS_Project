SDSGroup - jupyter notebook where I have cleaned and transformed all the data listed below, ready for Moran's I 
--------------------------
MSOA_2011_London_gen_MHW.(xxx) files  - London MSOA Shapefile data
--------------------------
London_dataset.csv - csv file of the spreadsheet made by Juraj. Also changed some column names to make it easier to code with (see python notebook for what means what)
--------------------------
msoa_ldn.(xxx) files - created from merging csv and msoa shapefile data together to create a geodataframe. Think you could technically skip the first part of the jupyter notebook to the 'Converting to GeoDataFrame' section and just read this directly in
